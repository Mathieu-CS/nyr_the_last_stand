### The developpement experience : 

This project was mostly positive and taught us a lot about working in group. We had some minor altercations but we always found a way past them. We learnt to communicate better and listen to each other. The decisions on the project were only made with everyone’s agreement and no one was left aside. This is the part our group was really good at, we always listened at each other’s opinion and most of the time we agreed which made the decision-making easier and faster. We also started to have more and more mutual aid as the project went on. We understood that to make it work and do our best we needed to help each other. This was something essential to the good running of our group work.

### Prides and disappointments :

+ Mathieu 
I’m pretty proud of the "Tank" enemy. It wasn’t easy to code and animate and it works fine. I’m disappointed by my Boss though. I didn’t feel like modeling and animating something special (like a big wolf as an example) to make a Boss which would have been cool. Instead it
is a bit simple for a Boss in my opinion. I’m not really disappointed for the website as it looks good in the end. However if i had to do
it again i would do it from scratch without using software like Hugo or Jekyll. The experience would have been more rewarding and i would have developed more skills in HTML and CSS. I know I’ll have to use these languages later at EPITA so it isn’t a big deal.

+ Maxime 

I am proud of what I have done so far for the project. I had the occasion to learn a lot of new things while being able to produce something real, and playable. C#, Unity, and Git management are of course great addition to my knowledge. At the very beginning of the project, I had a lot of ideas and of course some became true. Although, my biggest disappointment was to be unable to fulfill all of my goals. And even without that, we have a great project, and besides the "coding experience", this was also a great social experience. Having to work like that, on such a project, with other people was somehow an introduction to how will be our future work environment.

+ Liam

I am very proud of how my scripts are looking. They are well optimized to. They work fine together and there are no conflicts. The part that I took the most pleasure to realise is the levelling system. I had to to go beyond my limits in Object Oriented Programming. Syncing the level bar and the stats was lots of fun even tough it took a lot of time. The only downside is the multiplayer part. It made me fail all the object pickups scripts. I couldn’t find a way to sync the inventories and the objects you pickup which made me very frustrated.

+ Anita

I am proud of my work on the map even if I didn’t do as much as I would have wanted. I did everything that needed to be done I don’t have anything late for the map in respect of the book of specification. Moreover I really like what I did with the different maps and my team mates agree to say that my maps look really good. The non playable character is also something I’m really proud of since it depended on other parts such as the UI and I managed to do it well even if I had to learn everything about the UI. The part I’m really disappointed in is the saves as I said in the report, the saves were not what I expected and I had a really hard time doing it. I’m also a bit sad I didn’t get to put more diversity in the generated islands

### Examples of difficulties & solutions 

The following list shows some of the difficulties we encountered with explanations on how we solved them. *Of course we will not put everything, it would be too long*

+ How does the AI detect the player

We use the GameObject.FindObjectWithTag() placed in a script not implemented in the AI object so 
the operation only repeats once per frame.

+ Github desktop  

A problem was encountered with Github desktop after the second defense. Everytime I opened Github desktop to commit my recent work, most of the project just disappeared from my branch. To rectify this we created a new branch for me to work on since then everything works perfectly again.

+ The hosting of the site :

The hosting of the website on GitHub pages used to be impossible because the theme we use isn't supported by GitHub. To host our site we use the GitHub remote-theme plugin.

+ To be able to find a good player movement mechanic, which was easy-to-use but still suitable for the game's purpose:

After going through multiple designs, the point and click system was the best choice, first from a coding point of view, but also from a player's point of view.

+ The navmesh of the tutorial island :

We first thought that we would have to build it during the runtime but actually we just had to take the navmesh and save it in a folder to access it in game.
