### The developpement experience : 

Globally we are quite satisfied with our achievements. We have a good group dynamic and we communicate well. Overall, we are in agreement with what we planned in the book of specifications. For the moment, the game works fine, there is still a lot to do but we are confident and motivated for the next tasks.

### The difficulties & solutions 

The following list shows the difficulties we encountered with explanations on how we solved them

+ How does the AI detect the player

We use the GameObject.FindObjectWithTag() placed in a script not implemented in the AI object so 
the operation only repeats once per frame.

+ Github desktop  

A problem was encountered with Github desktop after the second defense. Everytime I opened Github desktop to commit my recent work, most of the project just disappeared from my branch. To rectify this we created a new branch for me to work on since then everything works perfectly again.

+ The hosting of the site :

The hosting of the website on GitHub pages used to be impossible because the theme we use isn't supported by GitHub. To host our site we use the GitHub remote-theme plugin.

+ To be able to find a good player movement mechanic, which was easy-to-use but still suitable for the game's purpose:

After going through multiple designs, the point and click system was the best choice, first from a coding point of view, but also from a player's point of view.
