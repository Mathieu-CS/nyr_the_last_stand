### The developpement experience : 

Globally we are quite satisfied with our achievements. We have a good group dynamic and we communicate well. Overall, we are in agreement with what we planned in the book of specifications. For the moment, the game works fine, there is still a lot to do but we are confident and motivated for the next tasks.
